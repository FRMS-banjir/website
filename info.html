            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>The vision of the Flood Relief Management System is to create a safer and more resilient community by leveraging technology to 
            provide real-time flood monitoring, accurate data analysis, and effective coordination between NGOs, government agencies, and rescue teams. 
            We aim to minimize the loss of life, property, and resources during flood events, ensuring that timely and well-informed decisions are made to protect 
            vulnerable populations and mitigate the impact of natural disasters.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Our mission is to develop a comprehensive and user-friendly platform that integrates real-time water level data, flood mapping, and alert notifications, 
            empowering stakeholders to take swift and effective action during flood emergencies. We are committed to fostering collaboration among various entities 
            involved in flood relief efforts, optimizing resource allocation, and improving communication channels to ensure that affected areas receive timely assistance 
            and support during critical situations.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>How it works</h2>
            <p>The Flood Relief Management System works by integrating hardware sensors, such as water level sensors connected to an IoT platform (e.g., ESP32), 
            which monitor water levels in flood-prone areas. These sensors continuously collect real-time data and send it to the central server via the internet.
            The data is then processed and displayed on the websiteâ€™s dashboard, where stakeholders can monitor water levels, view flood maps, and receive instant notifications.
            The website provides an intuitive interface for NGOs, government agencies, and rescue teams to track flood developments, coordinate relief efforts, and make 
            data-driven decisions to respond to emergencies effectively.</p>
